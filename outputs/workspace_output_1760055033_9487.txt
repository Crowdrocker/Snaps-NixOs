fMy Name is Matthew and my github is Crowdrocker WehttamSnaps on Twitch, and WehttamSnaps on youtube. I'm a full time wedding and photobooth photographer but I love gaming as well. I'd like to create a complete NixOS setup for streaming and work for WehttamSnaps. Coming from windows 11 BTW, also WehttamSnaps is my name spelled backwords. The Reason for NixOS is because the workflow is amazingly good. I started with Arch hyprland and then was introduced to Niri. My question is how do i convert over to niri from hyprland using NixOS? I know that Niri doesn't have much documentation and its gonna be a bit of a learning curve for me. but i like to explore and learn new things. Now that NixOS come with a Calamares installer its easier to install. I really like JaKooLit or Shell Ninja which is inspired by JaKooLit.  If i could some how convert those over to niri that'd be awesome. I know the JaKooLit has NixOS dotfiles installer for hyprland but not niri.  I was reading the NixOS wiki that the Unstable version is better for gaming and such

* Shell i found that i really like are: 
- noctalia-shell https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell.git A beautiful, minimal desktop shell for Wayland that actually gets out of your way. Built on Quickshell with a warm lavender aesthetic that you can easily customize to match your vibe. noctalia comes with just a shell itself or you can also combine it with the dotfiles with just a basic niri config.kdl and a kitty config. It's compatable with Niri and Hyprland

One thing that stud out to me about noctalia is that you can easily add more widgets following his wiki as well as Create my own Matugen template, which i'd like help with.

I used to have a dell studio xps 9100, which worked amazingly. But just the other day I was doing some work. and suddenly kept randomly turning off. After it did it about 3 times, it did come back on with a solid amber light. So I looked up the manual and it said it's usually the power suply or cmos battery. I changed the battery and new power supply. I powered up but now Post and the fans just kept spinning, I did more searching and some people with the same problem said to change the ram. That also didnt work. I decided to give up on it because i'm on a budget and money was running low and getting new parts. But as i figured that I most likely needed a new motherboard.  I just built a budget pc from an old pc I bought from facebook marketplace. I used the parts that I had already had from my Dell. It Has an i5-4430, replaced gpu with RX580, has 16GB ram, replaced hdd hard drives with ssd. 1TB ssd for games and files, 120GB for Linux and another 120GB for windows. Also replaced the fans and applied new thermal paste as well as a new power supply 750w with a single monitor. The CPU was running hot before the new thermal paste and CPU temps dropped 15-25°C under load.but not sure how to control the fans. It only had the cpu fan and I added one more. It's a small case so it can't fit too much in it. I have another gpu as well that I have from my dell xps 9100 which is a GTX 1650. I know its not much of a pc but it works for me for the time being unitil I can get a better one. 


 
My question:
1) Which one would benefit me most: the gtx 1650 or rx 580?
2) Should i fork a preconfig and tweak from there or start from scratch? 
3) I tested them and listed things I liked about them, Not sure how to kinda mix and match. If that's even possible without breaking something.

* First option which was suggested to me on reddit is install Niri dotfiles from https://github.com/Ly-sec/dotfiles.git with Noctalia-https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell
Things Liked: I like the overall feel of it and workflow.

* Second option is Hyprland using a recommended config from NixOs, Misterio77's config https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-config.git. He uses waybar but i would replace it with noctalia-shell
Highlights:
It's his NixOS/home-manager config files. Requires Nix flakes.
Multiple NixOS configurations, including desktop, laptop, server
Opt-in persistence through impermanence + blank snapshotting
Encrypted single BTRFS partition
Fully declarative self-hosted stuff
Deployment secrets using sops-nix
Mesh networked hosts with tailscale and headscale
Flexible Home Manager Configs through feature flags
Extensively configured wayland environments (sway and hyprland)
Declarative themes and wallpapers with nix-colors
Hydra CI/CD server and binary cache that uses the desktops as remote builders

Tooling and applications he use
Most relevant user apps daily drivers:

hyprland + swayidle + swaylock
waybar
helix
fish
alacritty
qutebrowser
neomutt + mbsync
khal + khard + todoman + vdirsyncer
gpg + pass
tailscale
podman
zathura
wofi
bat + fd + rg
kdeconnect
sublime-music
Some of the services I host:

hydra
navidrome
deluge
prometheus
websites (such as https://m7.rs)
minecraft
headscale
Nixy stuff:

nix-colors
sops-nix
impermanence
home-manager
deploy-rs
and NixOS and nix itself, of course :)

I would like to help with a Quickshell setup.  i'm  thinking of going with my second option. I'd like to may my own custom Quickshell bar if possible add some of my own widgets. something nice and clean also i'm not a fan the bar being to the left or right. but top or bottom is fine. I saw that Noctalia-https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell you can add your own widgets.
---


4) When all is done with everything, how do I go about saving my progress?
5) why is NixOS better with package management?
6) How can i include chaotic-cx/nyx and CachyOS kernal?
6) Can i convert things from hyprland over to niri?
7) Is it possible to separate niri config.kdl like hyprland so its not one long config
8) How can i use GRUB instead of Systemd. also how to use a shorter passwork instead of the Required 6 characters

I'd like if you can make a Component Integration Strategy, Component | Best Template | Modifications Needed. What to use as Base. Also how to incorporate work/gaming widgets in quickshell Noctalia and NixOs repo structure

-jarvis-startup.mp3 - "Good morning, Matthew. All systems operational." -  `exec-once` section to play `jarvis-startup.mp3`. make it conditional (e.g., check `date +%H` for "Good morning/afternoon/evening, Matthew").
-lets try this one-->jarvis-startup.mp3 - "Allow me to introduce myself, I am JARVIS, a virtual artificial intelligence. All systems are ready for gaming and work.
-jarvis-shutdown.mp3 - "Shutting down. Have a good day, Matthew." - Create a script (`shutdown_jarvis.sh`) that plays `jarvis-shutdown.mp3` before initiating system shutdown, and bind it to a key combination or power menu entry.
-jarvis-notification.mp3 - "Matthew, you have a notification." - Configure `dunst` to play `jarvis-notification.mp3` for incoming alerts.
-jarvis-warning.mp3 - "Warning: System temperature critical." - Integrate `jarvis-warning.mp3` with system monitoring scripts (e.g., high CPU/GPU temp, low disk space).
-jarvis-gaming.mp3 - "Gaming mode activated. Systems at maximum performance." - Create scripts that play `jarvis-gaming.mp3` and `jarvis-streaming.mp3` when these modes are activated (e.g., via Quickshell widgets).

###### Audio Routing like Voicemeter on Linux
----Use PipeWire with qpwgraph for advanced audio routing.
----Pavucontrol for simple volume management.
----Create virtual sinks and routes using qpwgraph to separate audio streams (game, browser, discord, Spotify).
----can provide a step-by-step guide for qpwgraph and pavucontrol setup.
-----Write scripts for J.A.R.V.I.S. sound triggers integrated with Niri or Hyprland events.

- Any help you can give me will be appreciated in helping  me and i'm up for any other ideas that i may have not mentioned. 
- I'd love it if you could send a full install script and structure for easy uploading and or copy and paste codes
